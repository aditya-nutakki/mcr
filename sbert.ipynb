Except for his youngest son, Onkar Prasad, all the other sons were allegedly separated from him and were staying separately. Brijlal was staying with Onkar Prasad and excluding the descendants of his other children executed the said Will dated 5th August, 1972, in favour of his grand-children through Onkar Prasad.

The Supreme Court noted that in a case pertaining to an earlier period from February 1982 to December 1982, the Collector had taken the view that the rotors and stators were incomplete and unfinished goods not known in the market as stators and rotors, and the Department had accepted this decision. The Supreme Court, keeping in view the fact that the Department had accepted the decision dated 21st July 1989 pertaining to the assessee itself on the similar goods, allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Tribunal, holding that the rotors and stators cleared by the appellant were not finished goods and were, therefore, not exigible to the levy of excise duty for the relevant period.\"}]\n",

During the period from 1930 to 1941-42, the appellant purchased a large number of shares and securities, which by 1941-42 were valued at Rs. 14.91 lakhs. He also sold certain shares and securities during this period and made profits, which were not assessed to income tax. In 1940, the appellant borrowed a large amount of money from his brother, the Maharaja of Darbhanga, and opened a new account (Account No. 2) for the shares purchased and sold using this borrowed money. In the assessment years 1944-45 to 1948-49, the profits made by the appellant from the purchase and sale of shares amounted to several lakhs, which the Income Tax Department assessed as business profits. The appellant challenged this assessment, arguing that the profits were capital receipts and not business profits.
